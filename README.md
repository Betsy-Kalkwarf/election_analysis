### Election-Audit Summary: 
The script for the Election Audit can be used for elections outside of the Colorado US Congressional precinct that Tom and Seth requested. The audit utilizes Python to count candidate vote totals and percentages. It also uses calculations to determine the winning candidate. The code could be changed to calculate the candidate with the least votes, or list the candidates in order by number of votes received. The audit also calculates the total amount of votes per county (and the percentage of total votes.) Then it uses calculations to determine the county with the largest voter turnout. With some small adjustments, this could be used country-wide and perform similar calculations about states.
